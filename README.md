# Toy Tale

Toy Tale is a simple web application that allows users to keep track of their toys. Users can view a list of toys, add new toys, and like their favorite toys.

## Learning Goals

- Set up event listeners to respond to user events
- Use `fetch()` to make GET requests, then render the returned toys to the DOM
- Use `fetch()` to make POST requests to create new toys, then add them to the DOM
- Use `fetch()` to make PATCH requests to update existing toys, then render the updated information to the DOM
